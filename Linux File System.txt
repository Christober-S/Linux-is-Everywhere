File System is used to handle the data management of the storage

The Linux file system has a hierarchical tree structure

with 1 root folder


Everything in Linux is a FILE

Everything in the system is represented by a file descriptor

Text documents, pictures etc.

Commands, like pwd, ls tec.

Devices like printer, keyboard, usb

Even directories. linux makes no difference between a file and a directory, since a directory is just a file containing names of other files
